# Guldhjerte
A basic substitution cipher used by Danish jewelers to obfuscate prices on exchange labels.

## How it works
Each number is substituted for the corresponding letter
| G | U | L | D | H | J | E | R | T | E |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 0 |

So 349 kr becomes LDT for example
